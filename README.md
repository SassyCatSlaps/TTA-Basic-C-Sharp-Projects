<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
<br />
<p>This is an MVC web app that imitates actions one would find on a car insurance website. This project takes in user input on their insurance policy information and calculates
quotes based in business logic. Included in this application is an admin page that allows apointed staff to view all generated quotes that have been issued.</p>

<h3>BlackJack</h3>
<br />
<p>This is a playable console application game that takes in user input and responds to it in a way that mimics a game of Twenty One aka Black Jack. This project includes generic class code and logic that can be resused and referenced
if one wanted to make other games involving a 52 card deck. This app handles a plethora of user errors that could occur and even imitates a casino that can check for things such as the player cheating. The project 
shows off many core fundamentals of C# and .NET framework</p>

<h3>News Letter</h3>
<br />
<p>This project is a simple MVC web app that performs functions that allow the user to sign up, edit info, and unsubscribe from an online newsletter or blog. It has an admin controller, user signup view models, custom cshtml, server validation, and contains code that shows multiple ways of doing completing tasks including commented out code that demonstrates the clunkyness of writing ADO.NET syntax.</p>
