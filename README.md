<br />
<p>This is a MVC web app that imitates actions one would find on a car insurance website. This project takes in user input on their insurance policy information and calculates

<h3>BlackJack</h3>
<br />
<p>This is a playable console application game that takes in user input and responds to it in a way that mimics a game of Twenty One aka Black Jack. This project includes generic class code and logic that can be resused and referenced
if one wanted to make other games involving a 53 card deck. This app handles a plethora of user errors that could occur and even imitates a casino that can check for things such as the player cheating. The project 
shows off many core fundamentals of C# and .NET framework</p>
