// ABSTRACT CLASS ASSIGNMENT

// Perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:
// Create an abstract class called Person with two properties: string firstName and string lastName.
// Give it the method SayName().
// Create another class called Employee and have it inherit from the Person class.
// Implement the SayName() method inside of the Employee class.
// Inside the Main() method, instantiate an Employee object with firstName “Sample” and lastName “Student”.
// Call the SayName() method on the object.
// Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
